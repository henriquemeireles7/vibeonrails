## What is VibeonRails?

VibeonRails is a **full-stack TypeScript framework** designed for AI-assisted development. It combines the best tools in the TypeScript ecosystem into a cohesive, convention-driven experience that is predictable for both humans and AI agents.

Think of it as **Rails for TypeScript** — opinionated defaults, clear conventions, and everything you need to ship production applications fast.

## Core Principles

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Convention over Configuration" icon="setting">
    Sensible defaults for everything. Override when you need to, but the defaults work out of the box. Every project follows the same structure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="End-to-End Type Safety" icon="approve-check">
    From your database schema through your API layer to your frontend components, everything is fully typed. No `any`, no runtime surprises.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Agent Friendly" icon="rocket">
    Every folder has a `SKILL.md` file that teaches AI agents (and developers) how to use it. Predictable patterns mean predictable AI assistance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular Architecture" icon="puzzle">
    Use only what you need. Every package is independent and tree-shakeable. Start minimal, add features as you grow.
  </Card>

## The Technology Stack

VibeonRails is not a new framework from scratch. It is a carefully curated integration of proven, production-ready tools:

| Layer | Tool | Why This Tool |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **HTTP Server** | [Hono](https://hono.dev) | Fastest TypeScript server, runs on edge, Node.js, Bun, Deno |
| **API Layer** | [tRPC](https://trpc.io) | End-to-end type safety without code generation or schemas |
| **Database** | [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) | Type-safe SQL with zero runtime overhead, great migrations |
| **Validation** | [Zod](https://zod.dev) | Schema validation with automatic TypeScript type inference |
| **Authentication** | [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose) + [Argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2) | JWT token management + secure password hashing |
| **Queue** | [BullMQ](https://bullmq.io) | Redis-based background jobs with retries, scheduling, priorities |
| **Email** | [Resend](https://resend.com) | Modern email API for transactional emails |
| **Frontend** | [React](https://react.dev) | Component library with hooks, CSS system, tRPC client |
| **Testing** | [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) | Fast, TypeScript-native test runner with great DX |
| **Build** | [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) | Zero-config TypeScript bundler |

## Who is VibeonRails For?

- **Solo developers** who want to ship fast without making architectural decisions
- **Teams** who want consistency across projects and developers
- **AI-assisted development** workflows where predictability matters
- **TypeScript developers** who want a full-stack framework, not a collection of libraries
- **Startups** building MVPs and SaaS products
