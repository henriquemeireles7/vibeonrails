# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Tone

- **Friendly but professional** — We're approachable, not corporate
- **Clear and direct** — Say what you mean, avoid jargon
- **Helpful** — Always guide the user toward a solution
- **Confident** — We know our product well

## Writing Rules

1. Use active voice ("Click the button" not "The button should be clicked")
2. Keep sentences short (max 20 words)
3. Use "you" to address the user directly
4. Avoid exclamation marks (max one per page)
5. Use title case for headings, sentence case for buttons
6. Prefer simple words ("use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate")

## Examples

**Good**: "Sign in to your account."
**Bad**: "Please proceed to authenticate your credentials."

**Good**: "Something went wrong. Try again."
**Bad**: "An unexpected error has occurred in the system!"
