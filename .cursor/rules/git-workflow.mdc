# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

## Branch Naming

- `feat/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation only
- `test/description` - Test changes

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First** - Break down into steps, identify dependencies
2. **TDD Approach** - Write tests first (RED), implement (GREEN), refactor (IMPROVE)
3. **Code Review** - Review after writing code, address critical/high issues
4. **Commit & Push** - Detailed messages, conventional commits format

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch
