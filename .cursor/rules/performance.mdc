# Performance & Build Guidelines

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Analyze error messages carefully
2. Fix incrementally (one error at a time)
3. Run `pnpm run validate` after each fix
4. Verify the full pipeline passes

## Context Window Management

For large tasks, break them into smaller steps:
- Single-file edits are preferred
- Extract utilities into separate files
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Keep files under 400 lines

## Runtime Performance

- Use the cache layer (`@vibeonrails/infra/cache`) for expensive operations
- Use the queue system (`@vibeonrails/infra/queue`) for background jobs
- Use rate limiting for all public endpoints
- Use circuit breakers for external service calls
